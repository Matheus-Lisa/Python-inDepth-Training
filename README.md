Exception handling in file operations
4. Error and Exception Handling
Common exceptions (ValueError, TypeError, etc.)
Using try, except, finally, and else
Raising exceptions (raise)
Custom exceptions
5. Modules and Packages
Importing modules (import, from ... import)
Creating and organizing Python packages
Standard library overview (e.g., math, datetime, os, sys)

# Stage 3: Advanced (High-Level Concepts and Specialization)
Objective: Achieve a deep understanding of Python and its advanced capabilities.

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes and objects
Attributes and methods
Special methods (__init__, __str__, __repr__)
Inheritance and polymorphism
Encapsulation and abstraction
2. Advanced Functions
Higher-order functions
Decorators
Generators (yield)
Iterators and iterable objects
3. Concurrency and Parallelism

Asynchronous programming (asyncio)
Differences between threading and multiprocessing
4. File Handling – Advanced
Working with CSV and JSON files
Handling large datasets with pandas
Binary file handling
Serialization and deserialization (pickle, json)
5. Error Handling – Advanced
Chained exceptions
Custom exception classes
Logging and debugging (logging module)

# Stage 4: Mastery (Specialized and Professional Concepts)
Objective: Transition from an advanced learner to a Python expert.

1. Memory Management and Optimization
Python memory model
Garbage collection and reference counting
Profiling and optimizing code (timeit, cProfile)
Using built-in optimization tools (collections, itertools)
2. Metaprogramming
Dynamic attributes and methods
__dict__ and introspection
Metaclasses
Monkey patching
3. Design Patterns in Python
Singleton, Factory, Observer patterns
Understanding when and how to use design patterns
Anti-patterns and common mistakes
4. Working with Databases
SQL basics and database connections (sqlite3)
ORMs (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM)
Transactions and error handling with databases
5. Networking and Web Programming
Basics of networking (sockets, HTTP)
Working with APIs (requests library)
Introduction to web frameworks (Flask, Django)
6. Testing and Debugging
Unit testing (unittest, pytest)
Mocking and test automation
Debugging tools (pdb, trace)

# Stage 5: Exploring Python Ecosystem
Objective: Become familiar with Python’s diverse ecosystem and explore new areas.

1. Data Science and Machine Learning
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
Data wrangling and visualization
2. Web Scraping
BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
Handling dynamic web pages (selenium)
3. Automation and Scripting
Automating tasks with Python (os, shutil)
Shell scripting with Python
Working with system tasks and schedulers
4. Security and Cryptography
Hashing and encryption (hashlib, cryptography)
Securing Python applications
5. Advanced Topics
Compiling Python with Cython
Integrating Python with other languages
Building Python extensions

# Learning Tips:
Stick to one resource at a time: Books, courses, or documentation. Switching too often can slow your progress.
Practice regularly: Focus on applying concepts with small exercises.
Review and revisit topics: Especially the advanced and high-level concepts.
Follow Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs): PEP 8 (style guide) is a must-read.
