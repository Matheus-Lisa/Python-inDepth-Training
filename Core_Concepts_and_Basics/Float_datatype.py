#A floating-point number (or simply "float") is a numerical data type used in Python to represent real numbers that have a fractional part. 
#They are used when precision with decimal values is needed.
#In Python, floating-point numbers are implemented using the double-precision (64-bit) IEEE 754 standard. 
# This format allows for a wide range of values but comes with certain limitations due to the way numbers are stored in memory.
