#Operators are special symbols or keywords that allow you to perform operations on variables and values. 
#Python provides a rich set of operators, and they can be broadly categorized into several types.
#In this explanation, we’ll focus on arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators, as requested. 
#I’ll break each category down with examples and explanations to make everything crystal clear.

#1. Arithmetic Operators
#Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values (integers, floats, etc.). Here’s a comprehensive look at each one:

a. Addition (+)

◘Purpose: Adds two operands.
◘Operands: Works with numbers (int, float) and even strings (for concatenation).
◘Example:
    
a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 8

# With floats
x = 2.5
y = 1.7
print(x + y)  # Output: 4.2

# String concatenation
s1 = "Hello"
s2 = "World"
print(s1 + " " + s2)  # Output: Hello World

b. Subtraction (-)

◘Purpose: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
◘Operands: Numbers (int, float).
◘Example:
    
a = 10
b = 4
print(a - b)  # Output: 6

# With negative result
x = 3
y = 7
print(x - y)  # Output: -4

c. Multiplication (*)

◘Purpose: Multiplies two operands.
◘Operands: Numbers (int, float). Also works with strings for repetition.
◘Example:
    
a = 6
b = 3
print(a * b)  # Output: 18

# String repetition
s = "Hi"
print(s * 3)  # Output: HiHiHi

d. Division (/)

◘Purpose: Divides the first operand by the second, always returning a float.
◘Operands: Numbers (int, float). Raises ZeroDivisionError if divisor is 0.
◘Example:
    
a = 10
b = 4
print(a / b)  # Output: 2.5

x = 7
y = 2
print(x / y)  # Output: 3.5

e. Floor Division (//)

◘Purpose: Divides the first operand by the second and rounds down to the nearest integer (returns an int).
◘Operands: Numbers (int, float). Raises ZeroDivisionError if divisor is 0.
◘Example:
    
a = 10
b = 3
print(a // b)  # Output: 3 (rounds down from 3.333...)

x = -7
y = 2
print(x // y)  # Output: -4 (rounds down toward negative infinity)

f. Modulus (%)

◘Purpose: Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.
◘Operands: Numbers (int, float). Raises ZeroDivisionError if divisor is 0.
◘Example:
    
a = 10
b = 3
print(a % b)  # Output: 1 (10 = 3 * 3 + 1)

x = 7
y = 2
print(x % y)  # Output: 1

g. Exponentiation ()**

Purpose: Raises the first operand to the power of the second.
Operands: Numbers (int, float).
Example:
    
a = 2
b = 3
print(a ** b)  # Output: 8 (2^3 = 8)

x = 5
y = 2
print(x ** y)  # Output: 25 (5^2 = 25)

#2. Comparison Operators
#Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean result: True or False. 
#These are often used in conditional statements (e.g., if).

a. Equal to (==)

◘Purpose: Checks if two operands are equal.
◘Example:

a = 5
b = 5
print(a == b)  # Output: True

x = "hello"
y = "world"
print(x == y)  # Output: False

b. Not Equal to (!=)

◘Purpose: Checks if two operands are not equal.
◘Example:
    
a = 10
b = 7
print(a != b)  # Output: True

x = 3
y = 3
print(x != y)  # Output: False

c. Greater Than (>)

◘Purpose: Checks if the first operand is greater than the second.
◘Example:
    
a = 8
b = 5
print(a > b)  # Output: True

x = 2
y = 7
print(x > y)  # Output: False

d. Less Than (<)

◘Purpose: Checks if the first operand is less than the second.
◘Example:
    
a = 3
b = 9
print(a < b)  # Output: True

x = 5
y = 5
print(x < y)  # Output: False

e. Greater Than or Equal to (>=)

◘Purpose: Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.
◘Example:
    
a = 10
b = 10
print(a >= b)  # Output: True

x = 4
y = 6
print(x >= y)  # Output: False

f. Less Than or Equal to (<=)

◘Purpose: Checks if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.
◘Example:
    
a = 7
b = 9
print(a <= b)  # Output: True

x = 5
y = 3
print(x <= y)  # Output: False

Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **).
Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
Logical operators (and, or, not).


Let’s dive into a detailed explanation of operators in Python! Operators are special symbols or keywords that allow you to perform operations on variables and values. Python provides a rich set of operators, and they can be broadly categorized into several types. In this explanation, we’ll focus on arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators, as requested. I’ll break each category down with examples and explanations to make everything crystal clear.

1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values (integers, floats, etc.). Here’s a comprehensive look at each one:

2. Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean result: True or False. These are often used in conditional statements (e.g., if).

a. Equal to (==)
Purpose: Checks if two operands are equal.
Example:
python
Wrap
Copy
a = 5

print(a == b)  # Output: True

print(a != b)  # Output: True

x = 3

print(x != y)  # Output: False
c. Greater Than (>)
Purpose: Checks if the first operand is greater than the second.
Example:
python
Wrap
Copy
a = 8
b = 5
print(a > b)  # Output: True

x = 2
y = 7
print(x > y)  # Output: False
d. Less Than (<)
Purpose: Checks if the first operand is less than the second.
Example:

Wrap
Copy
a = 3
b = 9
print(a < b)  # Output: True

x = 5
y = 5
print(x < y)  # Output: False
e. Greater Than or Equal to (>=)
Purpose: Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.
Example:
python
Wrap
Copy
a = 10
b = 10
print(a >= b)  # Output: True

x = 4
y = 6
print(x >= y)  # Output: False
f. Less Than or Equal to (<=)
Purpose: Checks if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.
Example:
python
Wrap
Copy
a = 7
b = 9
print(a <= b)  # Output: True

x = 5
y = 3
print(x <= y)  # Output: False

#3. Logical Operators
#Logical operators are used to combine or modify boolean expressions (True or False). 
#They’re often used in decision-making constructs like if statements.

a. And (and)

◘Purpose: Returns True if both operands are True; otherwise, returns False.
◘Truth Table:
    ◘True and True → True
    ◘True and False → False
    ◘False and True → False
    ◘False and False → False
◘Example:
    
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)  # Output: False

x = 5 > 3  # True
y = 10 < 15  # True
print(x and y)  # Output: True

b. Or (or)

◘Purpose: Returns True if at least one operand is True; returns False if both are False.
◘Truth Table:
    ◘True or True → True
    ◘True or False → True
    ◘False or True → True
    ◘False or False → False
◘Example:
    
a = True
b = False
print(a or b)  # Output: True

x = 5 < 2  # False
y = 10 > 7  # True
print(x or y)  # Output: True

c. Not (not)

◘Purpose: Reverses the boolean value of the operand (True becomes False, and vice versa).
◘Truth Table:
    ◘not True → False
    ◘not False → True
◘Example:
    
a = True
print(not a)  # Output: False

x = 5 > 10  # False
print(not x)  # Output: True

#Combining Operators

#In real-world Python code, you often combine these operators. 
#Here’s an example that ties them together:

a = 10
b = 5
c = 3

# Arithmetic + Comparison + Logical
result = (a + b) > (c * 4) and not (b % 2 == 0)
# Step-by-step:
# 1. (a + b) = 15
# 2. (c * 4) = 12
# 3. 15 > 12 = True
# 4. (b % 2) = 1, 1 == 0 = False
# 5. not False = True
# 6. True and True = True

print(result)  # Output: True

#Key Points to Remember

#1. Precedence: Operators have a specific order of evaluation (e.g., ** has higher precedence than +). Use parentheses () to control the order explicitly.
#2. Type Flexibility: Some operators (like +) work with multiple data types (numbers, strings), while others (like %) are more restrictive.
#3. Short-Circuiting: Logical operators and and or use short-circuit evaluation—Python stops evaluating as soon as the result is determined.
